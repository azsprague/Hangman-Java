# Hangman

## Overview
Simple hangman game using Java. I made this a while back but decided to make a repository for it anyway.
This game runs right in the terminal window using text (no GUI). There is definitely a lot that could be
changed with this system, especially having a better division of classes, but the game works nonetheless.
  
## Invocation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java ./Driver  
  
No additional arguments are needed; the game will prompt you to make decisions such as how you wish to play
the game and what category to use.

## Libraries
No external libraries are required for this game to run.

## Notes:
Additional words can be added manually to the text files if desired. When I made the system, I did a rather
lazy job and hardcoded the categories into the code; if additional categories are desired, you would either
need to hardcode them in or change the system to read all of the text files in the Prompts directory.
